# Rock Paper Scissors

Program a rock paper scissors game as a console application. The user should play against the computer which makes random selections on each turn.

The game should end when either the user or the computer gets to 3 points. At that point the user should be shown a message saying either "YOU WIN" or "YOU LOSE" and the program should exit.
